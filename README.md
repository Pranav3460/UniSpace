## 1. Project Overview

**UniSpace** is a unified, real-time campus management and communication platform modeled for modern universities and colleges. It consolidates academic life into one streamlined, highly-responsive application constructed from the ground up for absolute real-time synchronization utilizing Socket.io across all paradigms. The platform orchestrates complex multi-tier user architectures (Students, Teachers, Global Admins) integrating diverse scopes of operations simultaneously.

### Who is it for?
- **Students** — Can discover events, join and communicate inside dynamic study groups, locate missing belongings securely via the Lost & Found, tap into the Resource Library for educational content, track personal event request approvals, and interact safely via global components.
- **Teachers** — Empowered to oversee campus flows, supervise study groups, create authoritative events globally, post critical department-specific notices, and orchestrate student requests.
- **Global Admins** — Supreme controllers empowered with full systemic analytics pipelines, overarching user moderation, global alert broadcasting functionality, explicit content supervision, and deep-metrics assessment.

### Key Highlights
- 🔴 **100% Real-Time** — Socket.io architecture guarantees immediate updates across everything (Chat, Polling, Notifications, News, Broadcasts, Moderation, Approvals) avoiding manual synchronizations entirely.
- 💬 **Collaborative Study Groups [REVAMPED]** — Complete ecosystem with Chat Threads, emoji reactions, pinned messages, multi-role (Creator/Admin/Member) management, live Polls, Shared Notes, and orchestrated Study Sessions tracking live attendance and check-ins.
- 🏆 **Dynamic Event Hub + News** — A seamless ecosystem tracking Event lifecycles (pending → approved → completed) coupled tightly with a 24/7 autonomous Tech News scraper (Hacker News + Dev.to) operating across 4 independent Background Ralph Loops.
- 📈 **Admin Dashboard Suite** — Real-time telemetry monitoring new user growth, statistical breakdown of operational models, teacher permission orchestration, and Global Broadcasting.
- 🎨 **Unified Design System** — Encompasses comprehensive Light/Dark mode toggling driven by central `ThemeContext`, supplemented with immersive haptics, skeleton loaders, and SVG-styled empty states.
- ⚙️ **Rich Settings** — User-driven modular notification systems, granular profile privacy control (hidden/public), extensive theme customizability, and GDPR-compliant data exportation JSON facilities.
- 📴 **Connection Resilience** — Proactive internet disruption detection via `NetInfo`, prompting an automatic slide-down `OfflineBanner`.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Authentication & Authorization
The application implements pure session-based authentication leveraging state context and local persistence without volatile JWT overheads.

- **Login Flow:** Verified immediately via bcrypt password verification inside `LoginScreen.tsx`. Pending/Rejected teachers are aggressively blocked via server-side checks traversing `UserSchema.status`.
- **Session Persistence**: Initial app load intercepts `AsyncStorage` and queries `/api/user/profile`. Data gets locally mounted to the `AuthContext` enabling immediate rendering.
- **Sign-Up Pipeline:** Students inherit automatic `approved` status. Teachers fall into a quarantined `pending` status triggering `NOTIFICATION_NEW` socket broadcasts to Global Admins for review. Registration of `admin` roles via API is hard-blocked.
- **Two-Factor Configuration**: Placeholder integrated efficiently across the Privacy settings block.
- **Account Termination**: A multi-step confirmation validation in `SettingsScreen.tsx` prevents accidental destructive deletions, automatically scraping the user concurrently from all participating Study Groups arrays.

### 2.2 User Roles & Permissions
A highly granular matrix defining permission configurations derived from all application flows:

| Feature | Student | Teacher | Global Admin |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Read Notices | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Post Department Notices | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Delete Global Notices | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View Approved Events | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> \* Restricted strictly to designated Group Admins contextually.

### 2.3 Event Hub
The principal directory for tracking University events, hackathons, and gatherings.

- **Filters:** Categories include `Hackathon`, `Workshop`, `Seminar`, `Competition`.
- **Approval Engine:** Students queue events into a `pending` state which cascades an `APPROVAL_REQUEST_RECEIVED` socket to all staff devices instantly.
- **Moderation Workflow:** Rejections enforce a mandatory reason (≥5 characters). Approvals morph the state and emit an `EVENT_CREATED` push to all active user maps. 
- **Reactions [NEW]:** Users can visibly click interaction buttons (e.g. 👍 / 🔥) embedded straight into the cards updating the `reactions` map in realtime. 
- **Postponement Strategy:** Events can be relocated functionally via the `newDate` and `postponeReason` schema parameters.

### 2.4 Tech News Feed
Autonomous aggregation architecture scraping global technical knowledge domains.

- **Sources:** Integrated deeply with Algolia Hacker News APIs and Dev.to JSON trees. 
- **Ralph Scraper Loops:** Implements a rigorous 60-second polling architecture emitting `NEWS_FEED_UPDATED`.
- **Data Pruning:** Old caches degenerate gracefully through state arrays: `live` -> `recent` -> `weekly` -> `deep_archive`. 
- **Breaking News Engine:** Scanning titles for crucial lexicon. Upon mapping matches, broadcasts a `NEWS_BREAKING` interrupt via sockets, triggering an overarching modal Alert for all online.
- **Client Render:** Handles localized storage bookmark persistence via `useNewsArchive` fetching methodologies.

### 2.5 Study Groups 
A massively dense collaborative environment rebuilt specifically mapping the 5-Tab Architectural Flow.

#### 💬 Chat Tab
- **Threaded Communication:** Maps messages referencing origin payloads (`replyToId`), displaying beautifully styled quote boxes.
- **Reactions:** Socket-enabled emoji assignment (`group:message_reaction`).
- **Interactive State Tracking:** Global `group:typing` tracking indicators alert users exactly when someone is formulating a message.
- **Pins & Deletions:** Admins can pin primary messages at the top. Soft deletions replace text with a grayed *"This message was deleted"* marker preserving history integrity.

#### 📅 Sessions Tab
- **Lifecycle Management:** Creates strict `StudySessionSchema` payloads tracking `scheduled` -> `live` -> `completed` structures.
- **Reminders:** Incorporates a 30-minute interval check warning users impending logic.
- **Check-In Validation:** Live sessions unlock an interactive Attendance Mark Button inside the chat frame locking records dynamically.

#### 📝 Notes Tab
- **Collaborative Vault:** Embedded `SharedNoteSchema` mapping Markdown-like input structures freely editable by any cohort participant, tagging the `lastUpdatedAt`.

#### 📊 Polls Tab
- **Dynamic Voting:** Constructs interactive polling environments (`PollSchema`).
- **Live Bars:** Votes cast parse `width` interpolation animations globally reflecting percentiles instantly to everyone observing the pane.

#### 👥 Members Tab
- **Moderation Control:** Admins govern `demote`, `promote`, `remove`, `mute` flows. Pending Requests get authorized or trashed. 
- **Private Entry:** Private groups dictate a 6-digit `inviteCode` algorithm enforcing gatekeeping.

### 2.6 Notice Board
- **Filter Map:** Targets exact `department`, `year` schemas.
- **Calendar Widget [NEW]:** An interactive graphical scrolling date strip visually mapping key notices to calendar dot-structures at the immediate top of the board.
- **Full Text Search:** Leveraging native MongoDB `$text` indices to fetch parameters efficiently.

### 2.7 Lost & Found
- **Card Topology:** Image-priority scaling components visualizing missing items emphatically.
- **Lifecycle:** Reports switch instantly to `Claimed` when owners interlink. Soft deletion verification confirms ownership by checking the `reportedByEmail` string.

### 2.8 Resource Library
- **Upload Flow:** Multi-view 3-Step Wizard handling title metadata -> file processing -> final upload confirmation safely porting PDF encodings to Cloudinary.
- **Interaction Data:** Extensively aggregates `downloadCount`, `viewCount`, rendering usage analytics beautifully in the UI. 
- **Discovery:** Features advanced tag filtering combined with the `My Uploads` specialized toggle.

### 2.9 Profile & Settings 
Massively structured global configuration environment parsed across six functional hubs:

1. **Appearance:** 
   - Instant live toggling between `Dark / Light Mode`.
   - Typography modifier selecting `Small / Medium / Large / XL` adjusting scalar mapping globally.
   - Root configuration preset array shifting primary application semantic color gradients (5 presets).
2. **Notifications:** 
   - Strict Boolean mappings bound to AsyncStorage handling per-category opt-outs (e.g., Notice pings vs Group Message pings), completely respected by `SocketContext` parsing pipelines.
3. **Privacy & Security:** 
   - Account Password shifting algorithm. 
   - Profile Visibility (`Everyone`, `My School`, `Hidden`) integrated tightly to disguise details from global lookups.
   - Dual-Factor setup wrappers.
4. **Data & Storage:** 
   - Read-outs observing partition cache sizes. 
   - **Data Export Strategy:** Triggers a `/api/user/export` aggregate pipeline generating `.json` payload wrappers downloadable via `expo-sharing`.
5. **About & Support:** Terms of Service, Privacy logic, App Rating routing, bug handling.
6. **Account Handling:** Global Secure Sign Out and permanent wipe procedures safely resolving dangling arrays across MongoDB schemas.

### 2.10 Admin Dashboard
Elevated analytical rendering toolkits strictly segregated for Global Admins.

- **System Health Panel:** Visual tracking metrics determining API uptimes.
- **Global Broadcast Engine:** Intercepts text payloads launching an `ADMIN_BROADCAST` to all active Client Websocket Connections parsing immediately into high-level React Native System Alerts.
- **Analytics Visualization:** Line charts evaluating 30-day user growth tracking arrays. Bar distributions classifying event topology variables. Leaderboards prioritizing densely populated Study Groups.
- **Teacher Moderation:** Instant visual verification rendering lists of `PENDING` educators needing validation.
- **Global Sweeps:** God-level overrides capable of terminating any Notice, Event, or Group immediately to ensure campus safety guidelines manually out of bound.

### 2.11 Notification Bell
A persistent floating Bell rendered in safe-area spaces listening aggressively to `NOTIFICATION_NEW` and managing badge numerical counters visually. Triggers expanding contextual modals detailing the notification payload array correctly.

### 2.12 Global Search
Incorporated a robust standalone routing map (`SearchScreen`) with Tab Selectors querying Users, Events, and Resources simultaneously using optimized `$regex` and `$text` parameters via the `/api/search` backend gateway, displaying results safely using `SkeletonLoader` delays.

### 2.13 User Discovery 
Implemented specific Find People functions tied heavily into the `SettingsScreen`'s Profile Visibility logic (ensuring strictly matching "Hidden" status skips rendering completely on query iterations).

### 2.14 First-Time Onboarding
Executed a stunning, fully animated 3-swipe modal flow greeting users explicitly parsing usage details and visual aesthetic cues the moment they instantiate the build. Leverages `AsyncStorage` caching verifying the logic runs solely once.

### 2.15 Automatic Connection Monitoring
Pioneered a system-wide wrapper leveraging `@react-native-community/netinfo` identifying dropping networks, translating immediately into a smooth red slide-down `OfflineBanner` instructing the client context to pause mutating fetch operations.
